## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Final Code Review
1. Review all code changes in the last sprint
2. Ensure no debug code or console.logs remain
3. Verify all TODOs are addressed or documented
4. Check for hardcoded values that should be env variables

### Step 2: Build Production Version
```bash
npm run build
```

**Verify Build:**
- [ ] Build completes without errors
- [ ] No warnings about missing dependencies
- [ ] Bundle size is acceptable

### Step 3: Deploy to Lovable
1. Click the **Publish** button in Lovable editor
2. Wait for deployment to complete
3. Note the deployment URL

### Step 4: Verify Deployment
- [ ] Application loads without errors
- [ ] Authentication works
- [ ] Database operations function correctly
- [ ] Edge functions are accessible
- [ ] All pages render correctly
- [ ] Forms submit successfully

### Step 5: Setup Scheduled Tasks
Run this SQL in Supabase SQL Editor to enable the custody scheduler:

```sql
-- Enable pg_cron extension
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_cron;
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_net;

-- Schedule custody-scheduler to run every hour
SELECT cron.schedule(
  'custody-scheduler-hourly',
  '0 * * * *', -- Every hour at minute 0
  $$
  SELECT net.http_post(
    url:='https://tbmcmbldoaespjlhpfys.supabase.co/functions/v1/custody-scheduler',
    headers:='{"Content-Type": "application/json", "Authorization": "Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6InRibWNtYmxkb2Flc3BqbGhwZnlzIiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3NTM4MTQzMzcsImV4cCI6MjA2OTM5MDMzN30.4uJ4xpyZENd15IPQ-ctaouZ0Q7HFNr-CsRtJ0O7bqNs"}'::jsonb,
    body:='{"scheduled": true}'::jsonb
  ) as request_id;
  $$
);

-- Verify the cron job was created
SELECT * FROM cron.job;
```

5. Click Publish

#### Option 2: Rollback Database (Supabase)
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard > Database > Migrations
2. Identify the problematic migration
3. Create a rollback migration
4. Apply the rollback

**Example Rollback Migration:**
```sql
-- Rollback example
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS trigger_name ON table_name;
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS function_name;
ALTER TABLE table_name DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS column_name;
```

#### Option 3: Disable Problematic Feature
