## Next Steps

1. **Choose Integration Option** (A or B above)
2. **Update EnhancedAgreementWizard.tsx** to include new components
3. **Update Type Definitions** (src/types/agreement-wizard.ts)
4. **Update Step Configuration** (STEP_CONFIG array, total steps)
5. **Update Validation Schema** (src/lib/validation/agreementSchema.ts)
6. **Test All Business Config Flows**

## Technical Notes

- All components use existing LOV select components (no new API endpoints required)
- Mock data will be replaced when backend endpoints are available
- Validation schemas need to be updated to mark new required fields
- Currency is hardcoded to AED (UAE Dirham) as per business context
- VAT rate is hardcoded to 5% (UAE standard rate)
