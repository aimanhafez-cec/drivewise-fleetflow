# Phase 3 - Step 1: Database & API Setup - COMPLETED ✅

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Database Schema Updates ✅
Successfully migrated the database with the following changes:

#### Enhanced `agreements` table:
- Added `source_type` (reservation/instant_booking/direct)
- Added `source_id` to track origin
- Added `agreement_type` (daily/weekly/monthly/long_term)
- Added `rental_purpose` (business/personal/tourism)
- Added UAE-specific fields: `salik_account_no`, `darb_account_no`
- Added `cross_border_allowed` and `cross_border_countries`
- Added mileage tracking: `mileage_package`, `included_km`, `excess_km_rate`

#### Created `agreement_documents` table:
- Full document management with verification workflow
- Tracks: emirates_id, passport, license, visa, additional_driver
- Document sides (front/back/bio_page/visa_page)
- Verification status tracking
- OCR extracted data storage
- Expiry date tracking
- RLS policies for staff and customer access

#### Created `agreement_payments` table:
- Payment type tracking (advance/security_deposit/monthly/final/refund)
- Multiple payment methods supported
- Status tracking (pending/processing/completed/failed/refunded)
- Transaction and authorization reference storage
- Card tokenization support
- Receipt URL storage
- Metadata for flexible extensions
- RLS policies for secure access

#### Enhanced `inspection_out` table:
- Added `pre_handover_checklist` (JSONB)
- Added `fuel_level` (0-1 percentage)
- Added `odometer_reading` and photo URLs
- Added comprehensive `inspection_checklist` (JSONB)
- Added inspection notes

### 2. API Layer ✅
Created comprehensive API modules:

#### `/src/lib/api/agreement-documents.ts`
- `listDocuments()` - Get all documents for an agreement
- `getDocument()` - Get single document details
- `uploadDocument()` - Upload with automatic storage integration
- `verifyDocument()` - Staff verification workflow
- `deleteDocument()` - Remove document
- `checkRequiredDocuments()` - Validation helper

#### `/src/lib/api/agreement-payments.ts`
- `listPayments()` - Get all payments for an agreement
- `getPayment()` - Get single payment details
- `createPayment()` - Initialize payment record
- `processPayment()` - Complete payment with transaction data
- `authorizeDeposit()` - Security deposit authorization
- `failPayment()` - Mark payment as failed
- `getPaymentSummary()` - Aggregated payment stats

### 3. React Hooks ✅
Created React Query hooks for seamless integration:

#### `/src/hooks/useAgreementDocuments.ts`
- `useAgreementDocuments()` - List with auto-refresh
- `useAgreementDocument()` - Single document
- `useUploadDocument()` - Upload mutation
- `useVerifyDocument()` - Verification mutation
- `useDeleteDocument()` - Delete mutation
- `useRequiredDocumentsCheck()` - Validation query

#### `/src/hooks/useAgreementPayments.ts`
- `useAgreementPayments()` - List with auto-refresh
- `useAgreementPayment()` - Single payment
- `useCreatePayment()` - Create mutation
- `useProcessPayment()` - Process mutation
- `useAuthorizeDeposit()` - Deposit authorization
- `useFailPayment()` - Fail mutation
- `usePaymentSummary()` - Summary query

### 4. TypeScript Types ✅
Created comprehensive type definitions:

#### `/src/types/agreement-wizard.ts`
- Complete `EnhancedWizardData` interface (8 steps)
- All supporting types and enums
- Validation interfaces
- Progress tracking types

### 5. Storage Utilities ✅
Created storage management:

#### `/src/lib/storage/agreement-documents-storage.ts`
- Document upload with progress tracking
- Document deletion
- Document listing
- Signed URL generation
- Bucket access verification

### 6. Security ✅
- All trigger functions use `SET search_path = ''`
- RLS policies applied to new tables
- Customer and staff access properly separated
- Secure document storage integration

## Manual Setup Required

### Storage Bucket Creation
You need to create the storage bucket manually in Supabase:

1. Go to Storage in Supabase Dashboard
2. Create a new bucket named: `agreement-documents`
3. Set bucket as **Public** (for easier access) or **Private** (for more security)
4. Set file size limit: 10 MB (recommended)
5. Allowed MIME types: 
   - image/jpeg
   - image/png
   - image/heic
   - application/pdf

**RLS Policies for Storage Bucket** (if using private bucket):
```sql
-- Allow authenticated users to upload their agreement documents
CREATE POLICY "Users can upload agreement documents"
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'agreement-documents');

-- Allow users to view their own agreement documents
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own agreement documents"
ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
TO authenticated
USING (
  bucket_id = 'agreement-documents' AND
  (storage.foldername(name))[1] IN (
    SELECT id::text FROM agreements 
    WHERE customer_id IN (
      SELECT id FROM profiles WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
    )
  )
);

-- Staff can view all
CREATE POLICY "Staff can view all agreement documents"
ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
TO authenticated
USING (bucket_id = 'agreement-documents');
```

## Database Migration Status
✅ Migration completed successfully
✅ Security warnings from this migration fixed
⚠️ Pre-existing security warnings remain (unrelated to this migration)

## Next Steps

### Ready for Phase 3 - Step 2: Build Reusable Components
You can now proceed with:
- VehicleDiagramInteractive (2D vehicle with damage markers)
- DamageMarkerTool (damage type/severity selector)
- MobilePhotoCapture (camera integration)
- EnhancedSignaturePad (touch-optimized)
- DocumentUploader (drag-drop + camera)
- PaymentProcessor (payment gateway integration)

### Quick Start Commands
```bash
# Use the new hooks in your components
import { useAgreementDocuments } from '@/hooks/useAgreementDocuments';
import { useAgreementPayments } from '@/hooks/useAgreementPayments';

# Use the types
import type { EnhancedWizardData } from '@/types/agreement-wizard';

# Use the API directly (if needed)
import { AgreementDocumentsAPI } from '@/lib/api/agreement-documents';
import { AgreementPaymentsAPI } from '@/lib/api/agreement-payments';
```

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Create storage bucket `agreement-documents`
- [ ] Test document upload functionality
- [ ] Test payment record creation
- [ ] Verify RLS policies work correctly
- [ ] Test customer vs staff access levels
